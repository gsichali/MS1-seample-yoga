## Design

### Colour Scheme
I chose light-green and shade dull shade of beige because these colours balance each other and create a neutral zen feeling as a user is browsing through the website.

### Typography
The font used in the body is Montserrat, sans-serif from Google Fonts. I also used a bit of Lato, sans-serif for the headings. To break the sections out the colour I used a combination of Shadows Into Light, cursive and the shade of green to add colour.
